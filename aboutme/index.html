        <p>Hi everyone, I'm excited to be on this education journey with you. My journey has recently changed course as I recently earned my Basic Accounting Diploma from Ensign College but I have since decided to switch to Software Development. 
            Many years ago I completed a Diploma in Computer Systems Technology and I loved it. I didn't get to use those skills for very long before my first child was born and I decided 
            to be a stay-at-home mom. Now that my kids are growing up, I'd like to jump back in and give programming another try. 
        <p></p>While I work on this degree, I will be working, but at the moment I am between jobs because my family is in the process of moving from Lloydminster, Alberta, Canada to Lethbridge and we're currently between houses. 
        Prior to this moving adventure, I worked as a File Adminstrator for a land survey company.</p>
        <p>My family is my favorite part of life. I am married to a wonderful and supportive husband and we have 4 kids ranging in ages from 21 to 12. My favorite hobby is gardening and 
            I'm sad to leave my garden plot behind as we move to a new city. However, I'm sure I'll be able to keep myself busy and fulfilled with many other hobbies and pursuits. My family loves
            playing board games and hiking in the mountains. Our new city is much closer to the mountains, so that is nice. Between family life, school, work and church responsibilities my life
            has been quite busy but I love the path I'm on right now.
        </p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life and I have a son currently serving a mission in South Carolina. We are excited to be moving to
            a city that just had a recent temple announcement. It will be nice to live closer to a temple since our home in Lloydminster was over 2 hours away. I love serving in the church, 
            so I'm looking forward to getting settled into a new house and starting at a new ward. 
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for taking a minute to get to know me better!</p>
