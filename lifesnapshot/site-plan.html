        Hi, I’m Heather Gibb
        <br><br>This page will tell you a little about me and my life.
        <br><br>I have a wonderful family with my fantastic husband, Curtis. We have four children and live in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.
        <br><br>I enjoy listening to good music, playing board games, and chatting with friends. I love to spend time in nature. My family enjoys camping in the mountains every summer and I devote much effort into my garden; planting, harvesting, and preserving the food I grow.
        <br><br>Recently, I started work as an Educational Assistant, working in Kindergarten and I get to enjoy the energy and excitement of little ones each day. Prior to this job, I worked as a File Administrator at a land survey company. Even though I enjoy these jobs, I am aiming for something else.
        <br><br>I am currently working on my Bachelor’s of Software Development from BYU-Idaho and goal is to become a computer programmer working primarily with database development and design. Many years ago, I earned a Diploma of Computer Systems Technology and worked as a programmer for a few years before having my family. I am excited to refresh my skills and get back into a career that I love!

      <h3>My Family</h3>
      <p>
        A little bit about…
        <br><br>My Family
        <br><br>Curtis and I were married in the Carston, Alberta Temple on May 21, 1998, and since then have added four wonderful children to our family and are looking forward to future additions as they grow, get married and start having their own families.
        <br><br>Curtis
        <br>Curtis is a supportive husband and father who loves Lego, movies, Star Wars (the originals), and enjoys camping and hiking in the mountains. He recently started remote work as an Electrical Designer for Wood PLC. Before that, he worked as a Technical Resources Technologist for ATCO Electric.
        <br><br>Talia
        <br>Talia is a delightful and friendly gal who enjoys hanging out with friends while attending the University of Lethbridge. She is in her 4th year of a 5-year combined B.A./B.Ed. Degree. She plans to work as an elementary school teacher. Like her dad, she loves Lego and movies, mostly Marvel movies. Like her mom, she appreciates good music and nature. One of her happiest places is the mountains.
        <br><br>Alex

He is currently serving a mission in South Carolina and plans to get a Computer Science degree following his mission. He loves playing computer games and spending time with his friends.

      <h3>Gardening</h3>
      <p>
        A little bit about…
        <br><br>My Gardening Hobby
        <br><br>From start to finish, I love the whole process of gardening, even weeding. My garden isn’t super large but I manage to get my favorites planted each year. I try to fit in peas, corn, carrots, onions, beets, beans, tomatoes, zucchini, pickling cucumbers, potatoes and more.
        <br><br>Start Early
        <br>Early in the year, I plan my garden layout by mapping out what I will plant and where, and then I order seeds. In late March and early April, I start planting seeds indoors, like tomatoes, onions, peppers, and a variety of herbs. Because of our cold climate they need to be nurtured and protected from the weather for a couple of months, so they are put under special grow lights until they are ready to move to the greenhouse. Sometimes, the greenhouse isn’t enough, and we need to bring them inside for the night, so our kitchen becomes a temporary nursery, lol.
        <br><br>Prepare for Setbacks
        <br>No matter how skilled a gardener is, we cannot control nature, so prepare for setbacks and don’t give up! There will be good years and bad years, but there is still joy to be had in getting your hands dirty and being in nature. I have experienced flooding, hail, strong winds, and even poor germination due to poor seed or soil quality. Every year is different and there is often something that fails, but if I expect that, it is easier to bear when the hail comes down.
        <br><br>Enjoy the Harvest
        <br>There is a lot of work and a lot of joy in the growing process but don’t stop there. The harvest should be the best part! I love to see the buckets and boxes of food that I have grown. My parents taught me how to preserve these things so that my family can get joy and nourishment from my efforts well into winter. Some of my favorites are homemade salsa, pickles, blanched and frozen vegetables, and onions that last until next July! 
        <br><br>Give it a Try
        <br>If you haven’t had the pleasure of growing your own food before, you should give it a try. I enjoy growing tomatoes, peppers, and herbs on my deck each year. Even something as simple as a Basil plant can bring you joy, so why not give it a try.
