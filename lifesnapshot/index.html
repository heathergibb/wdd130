        <h1 class="hi">Hi, I'm Heather</h1>
        <p class="intro">I have a wonderful family with my fantastic husband, Curtis. We have four children and live in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.
            <br><br>I enjoy listening to good music, playing board games, and chatting with friends. I love to spend time in nature. My family enjoys camping in the mountains every summer and I devote much effort into my garden; planting, harvesting, and preserving the food I grow.
            <br><br>Recently, I started work as an Educational Assistant, working in Kindergarten and I get to enjoy the energy and excitement of little ones each day. Prior to this job, I worked as a File Administrator at a land survey company. Even though I enjoy these jobs, I am aiming for something else.
            <br><br>I am currently working on my Bachelorâ€™s of Software Development from BYU-Idaho and goal is to become a computer programmer working primarily with database development and design. Many years ago, I earned a Diploma of Computer Systems Technology and worked as a programmer for a few years before having my family. I am excited to refresh my skills and get back into a career that I love!
